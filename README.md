# DSA
This repository contains code implementations of key Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for learning and practice. It includes basic and advanced data structures (like Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs) and various algorithmic techniques (such as Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming). Each topic is organized into folders with code samples and brief explanations.
Contents

    Data Structures: Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.
    Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, and more.
